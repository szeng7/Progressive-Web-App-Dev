# Progressive-Web-App-Dev

This is a grouping of a couple of progressive web apps that I created for a presentation and demo of the capabilities of progressive web apps to the needs of the JHU BSPH Epidemiology Department. The department wished to create an app that would one, be handed on a tablet device to patients at a clinic in order to minimize the amount of paperwork that would need to be entered later, and two, be available for clients to access (through a link from an email sent to their mobile device) and fill out daily logs and questionnaires. 

Main features outlined were the offline capability, push notifications, easy accessibility on mobile apps (as well as quick download times) and background syncing, all of which is pertinent to the use cases the department outlined.

 **Weather App:**
    -Shows wide scope of usages for PWAs and demonstrates basic offline capabilities and downloadability (ability to save to homescreen)

 **Notetaking App:**
    -Shows another usage for PWAs as well as log-in features

 **Task to do List:**
    -Shows background sync capabilities and additional offline features
    -Explores uses of libraries (Workbox) and task runners (Gulp) to make development much easier
    
 **Hello World Program:**
    -Basic program used to show tech leads how simple making an app a "progressive web app" is (essentially just a manifest       json and a service worker)
